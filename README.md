# pendulumpsa01

This is the final project submission of Enrico Villacorta for Physics 215.

It attempts to apply PCA to a conical pendulum using videos of said pendulum and extracting the data via Python's OpenCV program.

The codes here are based on the codes of Mr Amancio Manceras II about applying PCA on the simple pendulum.

The Google colab page showing the codes for this final project can be found here:
